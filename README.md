# React-projects

Welcome to my React projects repository!

This repository contains two main React projects([movies](https://movies-02bf70.netlify.app) and [the-wild-oasis](https://the-wild-oasis-1ef4a.netlify.app/)) and some other React practices covering various topics.  

**Tools & Technologies**  
These tools and technologies are used in various projects of this repository:  
`React`, `react-hooks`, `props`, `API Integration`, `react-form`, `toast`, `modal`, `react-icons`, etc.

State management: `Redux`, `React-query`  
Styling: `css`, `scss`, `styled-components`  
Routing: `react-router`  
Backend: `Supabase`  
Caching: `Local-storage`  
Build-tools & bundlers: `webpack`, `vite`  

## Future work

In the future, I plan to incorporate the following features and functionalities into my projects:  
`Dark-mode`, `Authentication`, `authorization`, `statistiics`, `charts`, `Pagination` etc.

Also, I plan to implement unit testing using `jest` & `mocha` later on.
