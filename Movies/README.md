# Movie Search App


## Overview

This is a simple Movie Search App built using React. It allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and add movies to a watchlist. This README provides an overview of the app's features, installation instructions, folder structure, best practices, data flow, encountered problems, and suggestions for improvement.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Features

- Search for movies by title.
- View detailed information about a selected movie.
- Add movies to a watchlist.
- Rate movies.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Installation

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-search-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd movie-search-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Folder Structure

The app follows a structured directory layout:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React app.
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `assets/`: Images, styles, and other static assets.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the app.

## Best Practices

- Use functional components for UI elements.
- Maintain a clean and organized folder structure.
- Follow a consistent naming convention for components and variables.
- Make use of PropTypes for component prop validation.
- Utilize React hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) for state management.
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes using CSS media queries.

## Data Flow

Data is passed through the app using React props and state:

- **Props**: Data is passed from parent components to child components using props. For example, movie details are passed from the `MoviesList` component to the `MovieCard` component as props.

- **State**: Local component state is managed using the `useState` hook. For example, the `MoviesDetails` component manages the state of the selected movie and user ratings.

## Simplifying Props and State Management

To simplify props and state management:

1. Use a state management library like Redux for global state management if the app becomes more complex.

2. Consider using context and the useContext hook for sharing state among components without passing props explicitly.

## Encountered Problems

Some common problems encountered during development:

- Managing component state and props across multiple levels of nesting.

- Handling asynchronous data fetching and updates.

- Implementing responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Things to Avoid

- Avoid excessive nesting of components. Keep component hierarchies shallow and maintain a single source of truth for state whenever possible.

- Avoid overusing React context for global state management in smaller apps.

## How to Make It Even Better

Suggestions for improving the app:

- Implement user authentication to allow users to save their watchlist across sessions.

- Add pagination for search results to handle large datasets efficiently.

- Improve error handling and user feedback for network requests.

- Enhance the user interface with animations and transitions.

- Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to ensure app stability.

***Custom Hook***

Creating a custom hook for fetching and displaying movie details can be a good idea in many cases, as it can help encapsulate and reuse the related logic in a clean and modular way. However, whether it's a good idea depends on the complexity and needs of your application.

Here are some advantages of creating a custom hook for fetching and displaying movie details:

1. **Code Reusability:** By encapsulating the logic for fetching and displaying movie details in a custom hook, you can easily reuse this logic in different components throughout your application. This promotes code reusability and reduces duplication.

2. **Separation of Concerns:** Custom hooks allow you to separate the concerns of fetching data (e.g., from an API) and displaying data (e.g., rendering movie details). This separation makes your code more maintainable and easier to reason about.

3. **Abstraction:** Custom hooks can abstract away the implementation details of data fetching, error handling, and state management. This abstraction can make your components cleaner and more focused on rendering UI.

4. **Testing:** Custom hooks can be tested independently, which makes it easier to write unit tests for your data-fetching and data-displaying logic.

5. **Consistency:** When you use the same custom hook for displaying movie details in multiple places, you ensure a consistent user experience and behavior across your application.

However, whether you should create a custom hook for this purpose depends on the complexity of your application. If you're dealing with a simple case where you fetch movie details in just one or two components, creating a custom hook might be overkill, and you can handle it directly in those components. Custom hooks are most beneficial when you have complex data-fetching and data-displaying logic that needs to be reused across multiple parts of your application.

In summary, creating a custom hook for fetching and displaying movie details is a good idea when you need to reuse this logic across your application or when you want to maintain clean and modular code. It can make your codebase more organized and easier to maintain, especially as your application grows in complexity. However, for simpler cases, you can start with handling the logic directly in your components and refactor into a custom hook when it becomes more beneficial.
