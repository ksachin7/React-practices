In this Web-App we will learn about Creating React app without using create-react-app, Webpack, lodash, immutable, and immer.

### Required modules

```
npm i -D react react-dom Babel
npm i -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server webpack-bundle-analyzer
npm i -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
npm i -D html-webpack-plugin
npm i -D css-loader style-loader saas-loader
npm install --save-dev webpack mini-css-extract-plugin css-loader style-loader
```

The --save-dev flag is used with the npm install command to save packages as dev dependencies. Dev dependencies are packages that are only required during development and are not needed in the production environment.

Note that in newer versions of npm (starting from npm 5.0.0), you can use --save-dev or its shorthand -D interchangeably. For example, you can run npm install webpack --save-dev or npm install webpack -D to save webpack as a dev dependency.
